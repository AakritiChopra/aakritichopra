        <h1>WHAT IS HTML?</h1>
        <br>
        <h2><p>HTML (<strong>H</strong>ypertext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, 
            content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.
             As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p></h2>
             <h2><em>So what is HTML?</em></h2>
            <h2><p>HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. 
                HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to
                 make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to 
                 somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.</p></h2>
            <h2>Anatomy of an HTML element</h2>
            <img src="/images/grumpy-cat-small.png" /><br>
            <h2><p>The main parts of our element are as follows:

                The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
                The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
                The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
                The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</p></h2>
